            Whether you are a teenager in high school looking at whether to go 
        Xbox or PlayStation, or a parent wanting to give their kid the best 
        Christmas gift ever. The debate on consoles can be a tricky one. 
        Whether someone who loves video games yourself, or you know someone 
        in your life who does, finding the right console can be a foreboding 
        task. The goal of this website is to list possible pros and cons of the 
        three main current generation videogame consoles: Xbox series X, 
        PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
        
        <p>Keep in mind that opinions stated 
        here a just that, opinions. The pricing for the PlayStation 5 is about 
        the same as the Xbox Series X. Please note, I will be focusing on 
        differences between the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X more prevalently. 
        Something also to note is that all three major consoles currently have a 
        “cheaper” version, in the case of the PlayStation and Xbox, they have two 
        versions you can choose from, the “Standard” edition is what you would 
        normally expect from a videogame console, being able to put game disks 
        inside to play your games. But a cheaper “Digital” version is changed, and 
        the disk drive and all the components needed to read your game disks are 
        taken out. Saving you around $100 for the PlayStation and closer to $200 on the
         Xbox, with some major drawbacks though.
