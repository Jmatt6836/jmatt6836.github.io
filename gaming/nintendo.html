            Nintendo was one of the first gaming companies to ever exist, they created 
        one of the first at home gaming consoles and have been in the running for 
        best console ever since. But what Nintendo does that is different than the 
        other two companies is that Nintendo knows that the only place you will get 
        their games is through them. If you want to play Mario Bros, Mario Kart, 
        Super Smash Brothers, Kirby, Pokémon, Animal Crossing, and more, you must do 
        it through them. So, Nintendo has an interesting position. They aren’t 
        fighting against the other companies. All they need to do is to get you to 
        want one of their games. Most people, I included, who have consoles have a 
        PlayStation or Xbox and a Nintendo Switch. While not being the most frugal 
        option, it gives you the most games possible without having all three. Some 
        other Pros and cons of the Switch are things like portability. The Nintendo 
        switch is the only one of the three that is completely portable while also 
        being able to serve as a home console. A first of its kind, and while not
        possessing the best battery life. It isn’t competing against anyone else 
        for that. It also misses out on a lot of the “Cross-Compatible” games, 
        games like the Call of Duty franchise that makes games for both other 
       consoles. In the end, while missing out on some mainline titles that both
       other companies have access too. Nintendo has some of the most popular 
        exclusive games on the market and keeps its standing in the “Console Wars”.
