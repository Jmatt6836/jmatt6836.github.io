      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My elevator pitch is simple, I want to make a website 
          that compares the pros and cons of the newest Gaming Consoles. 
          I plan to look at why people would think to consider each option 
          and make the best choice for them. I also plan to show price comparisons,
           each company’s game options, and why each choice can be better or worse.
            My audience is going to be for people looking to purchase a new gaming 
            console and would like more information on what is included with each 
            console and which games they could play on each console.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> My audience is going to be for people looking to purchase a new gaming 
        console and would like more information on what is included with each 
        console and which games they could play on each console. I think another group of 
      people I will reach are people looking to buy a console for others but don't know
    what system they should buy for the other person.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Whether you are a teenager in high school looking at whether to go 
        Xbox or PlayStation, or a parent wanting to give their kid the best 
        Christmas gift ever. The debate on consoles can be a tricky one. 
        Whether someone who loves video games yourself, or you know someone 
        in your life who does, finding the right console can be a foreboding 
        task. The goal of this website is to list possible pros and cons of the 
        three main current generation videogame consoles: Xbox series X, 
        PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch. Keep in mind that opinions stated 
        here a just that, opinions. The pricing for the PlayStation 5 is about 
        the same as the Xbox Series X. Please note, I will be focusing on 
        differences between the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X more prevalently. 
        Something also to note is that all three major consoles currently have a 
        “cheaper” version, in the case of the PlayStation and Xbox, they have two 
        versions you can choose from, the “Standard” edition is what you would 
        normally expect from a videogame console, being able to put game disks 
        inside to play your games. But a cheaper “Digital” version is changed, and 
        the disk drive and all the components needed to read your game disks are 
        taken out. Saving you around $100 for the PlayStation and closer to $200 on the
         Xbox, with some major drawbacks though.

      <h3>Comparing and Contrasting Xbox and PlayStation</h3>
      <p>
        PlayStation pros and cons:
        The Sony PlayStation 5 is a behemoth of a gaming system, while currently, the prices 
        for the console have skyrocketed due to external forces such as shipping issues, 
        scalpers and more. If you can buy one at a decent price, this is a true force to
        be reckoned with. Both versions, the standard and digital have the same amount 
        of graphical, audio, and performance power (which can’t be said for Xbox). 
        Another thing to consider are the exclusive games that each company brings 
        to the table. While Nintendo has pretty much definitively the edge over both 
        companies due to having so many games made “in-house”. PlayStation and Xbox 
        both also have some serious contenders. The pros to the PlayStation exclusives 
        are that they have a lot of good single player story games in their collection, 
        some older ones include series like Uncharted, The Last of Us, Rachet and Clank, 
        Spiderman, and others gives you hundreds of hours of play time in their single 
        player worlds. And while both receive love from companies with franchises like 
        Call of Duty, Battlefield, Star Wars Battlefront, and more. If you’re looking for 
        single player games, PlayStation has it over Xbox by a longshot.
        
        While Xbox has its flaws when it comes to certain aspects of the so-called 
        “Console Wars” it is by no means a clean sweep for PlayStation. While both 
        versions available for the PlayStation have the same power, the extra $100 
        saved totaling to $200 less than its “Standard” counterpart do not take it 
        out of the running, while its power and graphical abilities are less than 
        the others, if it is not something that you worry about and just want to play 
        games for a lower price, this is a great buy. The Xbox also has its fair share 
        of games, and while I would say that PlayStation wins in the category of 
        Single-Player story games. Xbox has quite the grip of Multiplayer experiences.
         Games like Halo and Forza are top competitors for First Person Shooters and 
         Racing Games, and with Xbox’s Game Pass, you have access to hundreds of games 
         for free for a subscription fee each month. PlayStation does have one of these
          as well, but the games included on the game pass by Xbox value to a total 
          MUCH higher than PlayStations. As well as totaling to be cheaper than 
          PlayStations similar deals.

      <h3>Nintendo, The Third Contender</h3>
      <p>
        Nintendo was one of the first gaming companies to ever exist, they created 
        one of the first at home gaming consoles and have been in the running for 
        best console ever since. But what Nintendo does that is different than the 
        other two companies is that Nintendo knows that the only place you will get 
        their games is through them. If you want to play Mario Bros, Mario Kart, 
        Super Smash Brothers, Kirby, Pokémon, Animal Crossing, and more, you must do 
        it through them. So, Nintendo has an interesting position. They aren’t 
        fighting against the other companies. All they need to do is to get you to 
        want one of their games. Most people, I included, who have consoles have a 
        PlayStation or Xbox and a Nintendo Switch. While not being the most frugal 
        option, it gives you the most games possible without having all three. Some 
        other Pros and cons of the Switch are things like portability. The Nintendo 
        switch is the only one of the three that is completely portable while also 
        being able to serve as a home console. A first of its kind, and while not
        possessing the best battery life. It isn’t competing against anyone else 
        for that. It also misses out on a lot of the “Cross-Compatible” games, 
        games like the Call of Duty franchise that makes games for both other 
       consoles. In the end, while missing out on some mainline titles that both
       other companies have access too. Nintendo has some of the most popular 
        exclusive games on the market and keeps its standing in the “Console Wars”.
