                    <h2>Main Fork of Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p>
                        Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon 
                    river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return 
                    by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit 
                    and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.<br>

                        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and 
                    bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined 
                    with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the 
                    campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.<br>

                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of 
                    the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, 
                    faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late 
                    summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim 
                    tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                    <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                    <p>
                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most 
                        desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty 
                        Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful 
                        desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                        This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid 
                        (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
                        interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and 
                        historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
    
                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
    
                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
                        This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history 
                        that the canyon tells.

                        <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                    <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all 
                        river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
    
                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with 
                        breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. 
                        The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but 
                        with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                        
                        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The 
                        rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to 
                        accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
                        However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river 
                        rating scale, so we often refer to both.
